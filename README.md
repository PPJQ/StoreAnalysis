# StoreAnalysis

In this project we are going to review and analyze the information of a supermarket.

This dataset contains captures of detailed transactions from a supermarket, including product categories, unit prices, quantities, and gross income. It also records customer demographics like gender, payment method, and membership type.

We are going to analyze the following points: 

* Sale trends
* Customer behavior
* Revenue performance
